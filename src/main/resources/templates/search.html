    <h1>Welcome to the Recipe Search</h1>
    <p>One of the most popular New Year Resolutions each year is to lose weight. But diet is not exclusively about losing weight.
    Ones diet is simply their food and drink intake. The reason many of what we call 'weight loss diets' fail is because
    they are based on short-term trends. You will be in your body for a lifetime, therefore, your eating habits should be
    able to be maintained for that lifetime. </p>
