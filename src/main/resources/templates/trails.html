<h3>An integral piece of staying fit and healthy is to get your body moving. While a full on exercise routine sounds great,
   we do not want to discount the benefit of simply walking! Walking a few times a week for 20-30 minutes can greatly improve
    respiratory function as well as drop some pounds at a safe pace when coupled with a healthy diet. Plus, if you have
    a four-legged walking companion, they would benefit as well. It's a win-win for everyone!
    Use this page as a resource to find walking trails. Zoom in on the map below and see trails nearby to your location. Enjoy your trip!</h3>
