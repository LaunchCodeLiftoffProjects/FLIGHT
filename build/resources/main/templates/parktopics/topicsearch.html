      <p>Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that helps regulate calcium and phosphorus in the body.
          It also plays a role in maintaining proper bone structure. It occurs naturally in a few foods (some fish, fish liver oils,
          egg yolks, fortified dairy and grain products) but the most common way that we get this 'Sunshine Vitamin' is to
          go outside and let the sun rays shine down on us. On this page, you can search for articles composed by the <a th:href="@{https://www.nps.gov/index.htm}">
              National Park Service</a> that will hopefully lead you to some outside activity suggestions.</p>
